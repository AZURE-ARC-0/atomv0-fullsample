In this sample code, I've demonstrated how to incorporate security and privacy measures in the ATOM Framework by implementing Access Control and Encryption modules. The AccessControl class takes a secret key and provides a check_permission method that determines whether a user is allowed to perform a specific action. You can customize this method to implement your own access control logic.

The Encryption class takes a secret key and provides encrypt and decrypt methods for encrypting and decrypting data using the Fernet encryption scheme from the cryptography library. This can help protect sensitive data used in the ATOM Framework from unauthorized access or tampering.

The main.py file imports and initializes the AccessControl and Encryption classes with a secret key, which can be set as an environment variable for added security. These classes can then be used in conjunction with other ATOM Framework components to ensure that the system's data and processes are secure and protected.
