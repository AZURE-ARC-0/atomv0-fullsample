Here's a series of prompts you can provide to generate sample code for the entire ATOM Framework:

    Create a Task Representation module with customizable attributes, such as task description, priority, deadline, dependencies, and status. Provide a method to update the task status.

    Develop a Task Lifecycle module that handles the process of creating, updating, executing, and completing tasks. Include methods for adding, removing, and modifying tasks.

    Design a Task Corpus Management module that manages a collection of tasks, allowing for efficient retrieval, filtering, and sorting based on various criteria, such as priority, deadline, or dependencies.

    Implement an Evaluation module that assesses task performance, tracking metrics like execution time, success rate, and resource usage. Provide methods for updating and accessing these metrics.

    Integrate Heuristic Imperatives into the ATOM Framework by defining a set of rules or guidelines that influence task prioritization, resource allocation, and decision-making. Demonstrate how these heuristics can be applied during task execution and evaluation.

    Develop an API for the ATOM Framework that allows for easy integration with external systems and tools, such as data sources, user interfaces, and other AI components.

    Implement a modular and extensible architecture for the ATOM Framework, demonstrating how different components can be developed, tested, and updated independently while maintaining overall system coherence.

    Incorporate security and privacy measures, such as encryption and access control, to protect the data and processes within the ATOM Framework.

    Integrate continuous learning and adaptation mechanisms into the ATOM Framework, demonstrating how AI systems can improve task management capabilities over time by refining task prioritization, resource allocation, and decision-making strategies using machine learning techniques.

    Provide a sample application that demonstrates the complete functionality of the ATOM Framework, illustrating how tasks can be created, managed, executed, and evaluated using the various components and modules.

As you provide these prompts, I will generate sample code and explanations for each aspect of the ATOM Framework, ultimately creating a comprehensive codebase that demonstrates the full capabilities of the framework.
