    # Code for interacting with ATOM Framework components

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

In this sample code, I've demonstrated how the ATOM Framework can be implemented using a modular and extensible architecture. Each component of the framework (Task Representation, Task Lifecycle, Task Corpus Management, Evaluation, and Heuristic Imperatives) is defined in a separate file, and they are all imported and instantiated in the main.py file. This allows each component to be developed, tested, and updated independently while maintaining overall system coherence.

The modular design of the ATOM Framework makes it easier to adapt the system to different requirements, integrate new features or improvements, and troubleshoot issues in individual components without affecting the entire system. Additionally, this architecture makes it simple to create plugins or extensions for the framework, enabling users to customize the ATOM Framework according to their specific needs and preferences.
