# atomv0-fullsample
 Autonomous Task Orchestration Manager (ATOM) Framework sample code set
PART OF THE CODE BASE FOR Project-Simulacra-an-Adaptive-Persona-Simulation-using-chatgpt

please note this repo is still in development, this is the action management frame work sample code that is paried with remov4-0 to create CognativeAtomV1 for generative agents










Atomv0-fullsample
Atomv0-fullsample is a project that demonstrates the usage of the Autonomous Task Orchestration Manager (ATOM) Framework. It shows how to create and run tasks using natural language commands and queries, and how to generate code in various programming languages using the ATOM Framework.

Installation
To install Atomv0-fullsample, you will need the following requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.9 or higher
Transformers 4.11 or higher
NLTK 3.6 or higher
SymPy 1.9 or higher
You can install the requirements using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use Atomv0-fullsample, you can run the atomv0-fullsample.py script with the following arguments:

–language: The programming language to generate code in. Currently supported languages are Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript. Default is Python.
–command: The natural language command or query to execute. For example, “create a task that prints hello world”.
–output: The name of the file to save the generated code. Default is output.py.
For example, to generate a Python task that prints hello world, you can run:

python atomv0-fullsample.py --language python --command "create a task that prints hello world" --output hello.py
This will create a file called hello.py with the following content:

def hello():
    print("Hello world")
Examples
Here are some more examples of using Atomv0-fullsample with different languages and commands:

Language	Command	Output
Java	“create a task that calculates the factorial of a number”	```java
public int factorial(int n) {		
if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
    return 1;
} else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
}

| C# | "create a task that reverses a string" | ```csharp
public string Reverse(string s) {
    char[] chars = s.ToCharArray();
    Array.Reverse(chars);
    return new string(chars);
}
``` |
| JavaScript | "create a task that checks if a number is even or odd" | ```javascript
function isEvenOrOdd(n) {
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        return "even";
    } else {
        return "odd";
    }
}
``` |
