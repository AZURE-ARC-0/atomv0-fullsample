In this sample code, I've integrated Heuristic Imperatives into atomv0-fullsample by creating a HeuristicImperatives class that defines a set of heuristic rules or guidelines. Each imperative has a weight indicating its importance. The apply_heuristics method prioritizes tasks based on these imperatives and their importance.

In the example usage, two tasks are simulated with heuristic attributes. These tasks are prioritized using the apply_heuristics method, which takes into account the importance of the heuristic imperatives and their presence in the task's attributes. The output will show the prioritized tasks based on these heuristics.
