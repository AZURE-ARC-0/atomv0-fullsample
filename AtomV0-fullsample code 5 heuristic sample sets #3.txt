    def prioritize_tasks(self, tasks):
        prioritized_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda task: (self.heuristic_priority(task), task.deadline))

    def heuristic_priority(self, task):
        # Custom logic to calculate priority based on heuristic imperatives
        priority = task.priority
        # ... Additional calculations based on alternate set #2 heuristics
        return priority

# Integrate AlternateHeuristicImperatives2 into the main application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    alternate_heuristic_imperatives_2 = AlternateHeuristicImperatives2()

    # Apply alternate heuristic imperatives set #2 to prioritize tasks
    prioritized_tasks = alternate_heuristic_imperatives_2.prioritize_tasks(task_corpus.get_tasks())

This code demonstrates how the alternate set #2 of heuristic imperatives can be integrated into the ATOM Framework. A new class, AlternateHeuristicImperatives2, is created, which contains the alternate set #2 of heuristics. The prioritize_tasks method is implemented, which sorts the tasks based on a custom priority calculation incorporating these heuristics. Finally, the new class is instantiated and integrated into the main application.
