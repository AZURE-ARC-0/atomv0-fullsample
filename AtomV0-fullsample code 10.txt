This sample code demonstrates the complete functionality of the ATOM Framework. It integrates the various components and modules that were developed in previous prompts, including Task Representation, Task Lifecycle, Task Corpus Management, Evaluation, Heuristic Imperatives, the API, and Continuous Learning.

The main function creates tasks using the Task Representation module, adds them to the Task Corpus Management module, updates their status using the Task Lifecycle module, and evaluates their performance with the Evaluation module. Heuristic Imperatives are applied to prioritize tasks, and the API is used to retrieve task information.

Finally, the Continuous Learning module is integrated, using task data to train the model and predict the priority of a new task. This demonstrates how the ATOM Framework can manage tasks effectively in a comprehensive, flexible, and adaptable manner, with all the components working together.
