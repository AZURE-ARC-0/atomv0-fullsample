Here's a basic Python code sample for an ATOM Framework type system, called atomv0-sample. This sample code demonstrates a simple task management system that can create, execute, and complete tasks. Please note that this is a minimal example and does not cover all aspects of the ATOM Framework.

python

# atomv0-sample.py

import uuid
import heapq

# Task Representation
class Task:
    def __init__(self, description, priority):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.description = description
        self.priority = priority

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.priority < other.priority

    def execute(self):
        print(f'Executing task: {self.description}')

# Task Corpus Management
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_queue = []

    def add_task(self, task):
        heapq.heappush(self.task_queue, task)

    def execute_next_task(self):
        if self.task_queue:
            next_task = heapq.heappop(self.task_queue)
            next_task.execute()
        else:
            print('No tasks to execute.')

# Example usage of atomv0-sample
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task_manager = TaskManager()

    task1 = Task("Pay bills", 1)
    task2 = Task("Do laundry", 3)
    task3 = Task("Buy groceries", 2)

    task_manager.add_task(task1)
    task_manager.add_task(task2)
    task_manager.add_task(task3)

    task_manager.execute_next_task()
    task_manager.execute_next_task()
    task_manager.execute_next_task()

In this code sample, we define two classes: Task and TaskManager.

The Task class represents a task and includes a unique identifier, description, and priority. The __lt__ method allows tasks to be compared based on their priority. The execute method simulates executing a task by printing its description.

The TaskManager class manages a task queue using a priority heap to maintain an ordered list of tasks based on priority. The add_task method adds a new task to the queue, and the execute_next_task method executes and removes the highest priority task from the queue.

In the example usage, we create a TaskManager instance and add three tasks with different priorities. Then, we execute the tasks one by one in priority order.
