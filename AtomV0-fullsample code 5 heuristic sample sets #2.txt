This code demonstrates how the alternate set of heuristic imperatives can be integrated into the ATOM Framework. A new class, AlternateHeuristicImperatives, is created, which contains the alternate set of heuristics. The prioritize_tasks method is implemented, which sorts the tasks based on a custom priority calculation incorporating these heuristics. Finally, the new class is instantiated and integrated into the main application.
